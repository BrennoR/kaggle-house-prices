# kaggle-house-prices

This was my first start-to-finish Kaggle competition. It is regression competition utilizing the Ames Housing dataset.
I achieved a score 0.13256 which netted me place 1825 on the leaderboard. Not impressive by any means, but I learned a great
deal about feature engineering, data exploration, and model selection on this competition!

Initial data exploration and model experimentation was done in the dataset_exploration.ipynb notebook.
1st_model is the latest notebook with the current model used.
